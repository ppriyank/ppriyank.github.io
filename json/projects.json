We start with basic perturbations of the sound waveform and then move on to adversarial attacks. Given any audio waveform, we then apply our targeted black-box iterative optimization- based attack to IBM Cloud Speech-To-Text APIs and Google Cloud Speech-To-Text APIs. We are able to successfully at- tack the APIs by changing most of the original transcription.",
